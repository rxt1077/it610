Hello and Welcome to ElFroggo,

I'm looking for options for a quick interface to our frog database front-end and I'm thinking about using Flask and PostgreSQL.
Do you have some way I could test this environment on my Desktop?
I'd like a couple of rows of test data in a table called `Frogs` with the columns `ID`, `Name`, `ScientificName`, `Color`.
I'd also like a Flask example that shows how to use the `psycopg2-binary` package to connect to the db.

Thanks,
