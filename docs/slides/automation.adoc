= Automation

Automate the Boring Stuff (TM)

== Python

* Huge library base
* Easy to get started
* Binaries for everything
* Easy(ish) to maintain
* “I’m not really a coder”

== BASH Scripts

* They get the job done
* If you can type on the command line, you can understand it
* Consider migrating if they get huge
* Any Linux system has a BASH interpreter
* Pray to the dark gods of weird variables (IFS)
* The syntax may poison your soul

== Cron / At

* at - run once _at_ a later time
* cron - run repeatedly according to a schedule
* Every user (even root) can have a crontab that runs with their permissions
* man cron, crontab -e
* You better hope the cron daemon keeps running
* If your container has a cronjob, you're doing it wrong

== Push vs Pull

* Hybrid solutions are probably best (pull, but push when needed)
* Some automation systems periodically check in (Puppet, Chef)
* https://clusterlabs.org/[High availability software can be used to check
  system status]

== What should I automate?

* Provisioning
* Deployment (git)
* Backups (rsync)
* Configuration
* Security
* Orchestration
* Coffee? (in proportion to server load or maybe the ticketing system?

== Ansible

[.shrink]
* Python based
* Communicates over SSH
* Push (can also do pull)
* YAML (watch your spaces)
* Playbooks
* Roles
* Lots of Modules
* Descriptive: Define what you want to end up with
* Get ready for the cloud
* "I don't need Ansible, I'll just put all that in the Dockerfile"

== It's all in your head

* Change the way you think, tools will always change
* What do I spend my time doing?
* What provides the best experience for your users?
* Can I automate and monetize something that others are doing by hand?
