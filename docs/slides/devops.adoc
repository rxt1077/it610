= DevOps and Beyond!

== Traditional Sysadmin

* Configure
* Operate
* Maintain

== The Infamous Figure Eight

== CI/CD

* Automation applied to testing and deployment
* Continuous Integration is the automatic testing of changes
* Continuous Deployment is the automatic deployment of changes
* Incremental updates are the new normal
* A git push should be able to trigger the whole process

== DevOps Engineer

* Hardware in the cloud
* Everything is code
* YAML engineers
* Can do what the sysadmin could do and then some
* Creates/maintains the CI/CD pipelines

== Is the Sysadmin Dead?

* Nope, they’re just learning to code
* They have the expertise in uptime and hardware problems which translate to
  software problems
* An empowered sysadmin can do more, much more
* Experience matters

== Where we are now

[.shrink]
* Failure is an option, do it quickly
* Virtualize everything
* Continuous deployment is expected
* Rapid automated response
* Downtime for maintenance is passe
* Run on anything (heck Amazon is making chips now)
* Automate, automate, automate
* Save configurations, not images

== Tools that make it possible

* Automation tools: scripts, Ansible, etc.
* VMs - EC2, Google Cloud, Linode
* Containers - Docker, RKT, LXC, Podman
* Deterministic packages / package managers
* Serverless solutions: AWS Lambda

== How do you keep up?

[.shrink]
* I’ve given you overviews of lots of tools, they aren’t the only ones
* Concepts > Use Instances
* Read, share, contribute
* Learn from past mistakes
* Don’t believe the hype, think for yourself
* Argue and learn
* Insular sysadmin culture is dead
* Personal thoughts on the future: distributed, decentralized, mesh,
  deterministic, code as literacy
