= Docker Best Practices

image::docker-logo.png[]

== Why Docker?

* Creates a reproducible system to run software
* "It runs on my machine!" -> "Great, let's ship your machine."
* Makes sharing and collaboration easier
* Forces focus on configuration

== Why _Not_ Docker?

* Don't use it just because containers are new or trendy
* It won't fix crumby practices
* It doesn't _necessarily_ simplify things

== Directory Structure

* A Dockerfile should be in its own directory
* Support files, configuration etc., can be in any structure within that directory
* You will COPY support files into the container
* Avoid too much configuration in the Dockerfile if you can: RUN commands with sed, etc.

== WORKDIR, ENTRYPOINT, CMD

* WORKDIR is the "home" directory of the Docker user (usually root)
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[ENTRYPOINT is the command a container runs (possibly w/options)]
* CMD provides defaults for executing a container, typically parameters

== Running in the Foreground and Logging

* Docker expects one process running in the foreground
* Logs should go to stdout and will be stored by Docker
* They can be retrieved with the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/[docker logs] command

== Docker Volumes

* Docker volumes should be used for persistent data
* Don't assume they will be ready to go when your container starts
* May have to detect the state of the volume and build DB (or other things) as needed
* Docker bind mounts can be used to edit configs while something is running
* Bind mounts are typically used in debugging and stripped from production

== https://docs.docker.com/network/[Docker Networks]

* Single container systems will typically only need port forwarding
* Docker Compose takes away some of the networking pain
* Lots of options: bridge (default), host, overlay, macvlan, none, plugins
* Networking is a pain point for deployment

== Using Environment Variables

* Secrets can be stored in environment variables
* Environment variables can be stored in a `.env` file
* Don't put your `.env` file in version control!
* Environment variables can and should be used to make images modular

== Dockerfile/Image/Container

* We're making Dockerfiles to store configuration
* IRL once you get an image you'll push it to an in-house container registry
* When you run an image it becomes a container
