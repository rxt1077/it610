== https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/libc.7.html[libc]

* Standard C Libraries on Linux
* Used by all common UNIX tools
* Most common is glibc (GNU libc), but there is also uClibc, dietlibc, and musl libc
* Small libc libraries are increasingly popular in containers

== Purpose

* Linux systems are made up of a large collection of software
* Package management makes it easy to upgrade/install/remove individual pieces
  of software
* What kind of software are we talking about?
* Dependency tracking is the largest hurdle and different distributions handle
  it in different ways

== Package Management by Distro

There are many different linux distributions available. Let's look at how some
of them handle package management.

=== Slackware
* tarballs of files
* simplest and oldest
* No dependency tracking

=== Debian/Ubuntu
* dpkgs usually installed with apt or another front end
* allows scripting
* has _extensive_ dependency management

=== Redhat/CentOS/Fedora
* RPMs usually installed with yum or another front end
* allows scripting
* has extensive dependency management

=== Gentoo
* source based ebuilds (BSD lineage)
* allows scripting
* has dependency management

=== Arch (BTW...)
* PKGBUILD source system that creates binary packages
* packages can be installed with pacman
* allows scripting
* has dependency management

== Rolling Releases vs. Point Releases

* Most distributions have point releases where MAJOR changes will be a new version and the old versions will continue to be supported for a certain amount of time (LTS)
* Arch and Gentoo use the rolling release model where each package is updated to the latest version as it becomes available

== "Why should I update? Everything works."

[.shrink]
* Security patches
* Mature software in a point release actually doesn’t change that much
* What if something breaks?
** Backups and filesystem snapshots
** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/79050/can-i-rollback-an-apt-get-upgrade-if-something-goes-wrong[“Rollback” apt]
** Triage your updates
** What if something is GOING to break?

== apt: Advanced Package Tool

[.shrink]
* Used in debian based systems to allow updating and installing packages from repositories
* Partly a front end for dpkg
* Most of the things you used to use apt-get for can now be done with the apt binary
* apt update: Download package lists from repositories
* apt upgrade: Upgrade packages from repositories
* apt full-upgrade: Remove packages if needed to make dependencies work (used to be apt-get dist-upgrade)

== Functional Package Management

* This is a relatively new way of doing things where you can have multiple
  versions of packages in isolation. Each package has _exactly_ what it wants.
* Both examples we will talk about also offer stand-alone package managers since
  the packages are installed in an independent store. This has helped with
  adoption.

=== https://nixos.org/[NixOS]

* Declarative system structure
* Atomic upgrades
* Rollbacks
* Reproducible system configurations (container replacers?)
* Lots of symlinks!

=== https://guix.gnu.org/[GUIX] (pronounced GEEKS)

* Based on Nix, so everything mentioned previously
* Guile scheme as base language instead of a DSL
* Emphasis on free (as in freedom) software

== Specific Environment Package Managers

* pip - Python package manager
* npm - NodeJS package manager

== Why talk about package management?

* Many problems solved by complex virtualization solutions are actually package management issues
* Applications may rely on environment package managers which can cause headaches
* Knowing how to package things makes deployment much easier
