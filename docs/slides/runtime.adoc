= Container Runtimes

== Background

* Recall that containers are largely just
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces[namespaces] and
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups[cgroups]
* A container runtime is the software that is used to support the
  containerization of software

=== What specifically does a runtime do?

* image management
* lifecycle management
* creation
* resource management

== Docker (original)

[.shrink]
* One of the first runtimes, and as such many things strive to be Docker
  compatible.
* Runs on many platforms and is easy to use
* Extremely popular _not just for the runtime_ but also for the tools that
  work with it such as their container registry Docker Hub.
* Supports app containers
* Requires a daemon to be running as root
* Losing ground in the production environment, but still common on dev machines

=== Old Docker

image::old-docker.png[]

== containerd

* Born from the Open Container Initiative (OCI) which was created to make open
  standards for containers
* Daemon that runs in the background and supports app containers (sound
  familiar?)
* Relies on a lower-level tool called runc (written by Docker)
* Current versions of Docker run on containerd

== runc

* Universal, lightweight container runtime
* Designed for security
* No Docker dependencies
* Supports a very simple model of container execution

=== New Docker

== CRI-O

* Implements Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) with OCI standards
* Runs as a daemon
* Support app containers
* Bridges the gap between K8s and containers, no need to run a `docker` command
  in-between
* Not meant for use by devs

=== CRI-O

image::cri-o.png[width=50%]

== Podman

* daemonless tool to use OCI containers
* has a similar CLI to `docker`
* supports similar features as `docker`
* Linux only

== LXC

* Container engine designed for _system_ containers
* Rootless, daemonless, and fast
* Keep this in mind if you encounter a _tough_ virtualization feature
* Works with tools Linux admins are already familiar with
* Linux only

== Just for fun: https://github.com/p8952/bocker[Bocker]

* A lot of what Docker does can be implemented in around 100 lines of BASH
* Remember these are things that are _already_ built in to the Linux kernel
* Obviously Linux only

== What does this mean?

* As a sysadmin, you have options
* Almost all Linux-based
* A few kernel features can spawn a massive shift in software deployment

== Don't forget to demonstrate...

* the Docker daemon running
* a `docker save` to show the structure of the filesystem
