== Mounting in *nix

[.shrink]
* All sorts of things can be mounted at points in the file system
* Checkout the output of the mount command
* df shows disk usage for currently mounted things
* /etc/fstab shows you what things are typically mounted at boot
* Things can be mounted on top of one another!
* Block devices are typically mounted in /mnt or /media
* Docker will bind mount directories or mount volumes INTO your containers

== Filesystems

[.shrink]
* Kernel modules can be loaded to support file systems
* FUSE - file systems can also be setup in userspace
* What is currently supported? (cat /proc/filesystems)
* We often think of filesystems on block devices
* lsblk will show you your block devices
* fdisk (or cfdisk) can be used to see the partition scheme of a disk
** /dev/sda is the disk
** /dev/sda1 is the partition
** /dev/sdb is the NEXT disk
** YES YOU CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING

== Filesystems in Docker

[.column]
* Docker uses an overlay fs (implementation differs depending on underlying OS)
* The filesystem a container sees is the thin, top-most layer
* Copy-on-Write (COW) means layers can be shared and copies are only made when needed

.Development Environment

rectangle host as "Host OS (Windows)"

== Common Filesystems by OS

[.column.shrink]
DOS:: fat12, fat16, fat32, vfat (probably the most widely supported)
Windows:: NTFS, ReFS
Linux:: ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs, btrfs, zfs

.Key Features
[.column.shrink]
* scalability
* cryptography
* resilience (CoW, atomic transactions)
* replication

[.columns]
== Network File Systems

[.column.shrink]
* SMB
* NFS
* AFS (you should know this one)
* These are usually a daemon running in the background, but can be implemented
  partially in the kernel or with FUSE.

.Common Problems
[.column.shrink]
* keeping things in sync
* permissions
* minimizing bandwidth usage
* caching

== RAID

Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independant Disks

[.shrink]
RAID 0:: Striping for speed, make sure your controller can handle the bps
RAID 1:: Redundancy for high availability. Make sure your controller can handle hot-swapping
RAID 5:: Striping AND redundancy. Minimum three disks. A SINGLE lost disk can be recovered from but it takes a while to rebuild the array.
RAID 1 + 0:: Combination of RAID 0 and 1 for speed AND redundancy. More resilient than RAID 5 but less efficient usage of space.
