= Exercise 7

In this exercise you will be using a local Kubernetes option and going through
the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/[Hello Minikube]
tutorial. Despite its name,
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/[Hello Minikube] should
work on any Kubernetes cluster.

NOTE: You can also complete this using the Katacoda terminal, but in the future
you _will_ need a local k8s environment as you will be providing/creating your
own YAML files.
