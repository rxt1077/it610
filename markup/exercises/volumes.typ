== Creating a Volume

Create a volume with the `docker volume create` command and check to see if it is
there with the `docker volume ls` command:

#code()[
  ```console
  $ docker volume create db-data
  db-data
  $ docker volume ls
  DRIVER    VOLUME NAME      
  local     db-data
  ```
]

#admonition[
  Docker volumes are stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume-name>`.
  If you're not running Docker natively (in Linux) that means your volumes live in that folder in a virtual drive used by your Docker Linux VM.
  That makes them pretty tough to get to without using Docker!
]

== Running PostgreSQL

Now let's run a postgres container in the background with our volume mounted in `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, which is the path where the PostgreSQL database information is stored by default:

#code([
  ```console
  $ docker run -d --mount source=db-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data -e \ <1> <2>
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme postgres
  26618a503c688c19728c87190beb7497f68b6e7d350b09e3eae7f2f71b1c8738 <3>
  $ docker ps <4>
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS \
  NAMES
  26618a503c68   postgres   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   28 seconds ago   Up 28 seconds   5432/tcp \
  gifted_montalcini
  ```
], callouts: (
  ("<1>", [
    The `\` character is a line continuation.
    It means that the text below it, starting with "POSTGRES_PASSWORD", is actually on the same line but it couldn't fit on the screen.]),
  ("<2>", [
    Here's an explanation of some of the options and arguments:

    / `-d`: run in the background (daemon)
    / `--mount source=db-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data`: mount the `exercise4-db` local volume in the `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory of the container
    / `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme`: set the environment variable fo the postgres password to `changeme`.
      PostgreSQL won't start without a password.
    / `postgres`: run the postgres image]),
  ("<3>", [Your output may be slightly different if you don't have the `postgres` image available locally.]),
  ("<4>", [This is just to confirm that it's running]),
))

You can also check the logs to see how things went with `docker logs <CONTAINER ID>` where `<CONTAINER ID>` is the id from your `ps` command.

== Creating a New Database

The easiest way to create a new database on our running container would be with the psql command.
Fortunately the psql command is already on our container so we can `exec` it from there.
Let's connect to our database and put some data in there:

#code([
  ```console
  $ docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> psql --username=postgres <1>
  psql (16.1 (Debian 16.1-1.pgdg120+1))
  Type "help" for help.

  postgres=# CREATE DATABASE top_secret; <2>
  CREATE DATABASE
  postgres=# \c top_secret
  You are now connected to database "top_secret" as user "postgres".
  top_secret=# CREATE TABLE spies (name VARCHAR(64));
  CREATE TABLE
  top_secret=# INSERT INTO spies (name) VALUES ('Bob');
  INSERT 0 1
  top_secret=# \q <3>
  ```
], callouts: (
  ("<1>", [
    Here is an explanation of the options:

    / `exec`: run a command _on an already running container_
    / `-it`: run interactively
    / `<CONTAINER ID>`: your container id as listed in the `ps` output above
    / `psql`: run the psql command (command line SQL client)
    / `--username=postgres`: this argument is passed to the `psql` command, it says you want to connect as the default postgres user]),
  ("<2>", [These psql commands create a bit of data for us to use]),
  ("<3>", [`\q` exits psql])
))

== Backing up the Database Directory

Now we will start another container, that uses the same volume as our postgres container.
On the new container we will use the `tar` command to make a compressed archive the database directory:

#code([
  ```console
  $ docker run --rm --volumes-from 26618a503c68 -v "$(pwd):/backup" ubuntu \ <1>
  tar caf /backup/db-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/postgresql/data
  tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
  $ ls


      Directory: C:\Users\rxt1077\temp\


  Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
  ----                 -------------         ------ ----
  -a----         9/19/2024   5:32 PM        6749916 db-backup.tar.gz <2>
  ```
], callouts: (
  ("<1>", [
    This is a long command, so lets take it argument-by-argument:
    / `run`: start a new container and run a command on it
    / `--rm`: don't archive this container when we are done, it's temporary
    / `--volumes-from <CONTAINER ID>`: give us the same volumes at the same mountpoints as our running postgres container
    / `-v "$(pwd):/backup"`: bind mount the local working directory to `/backup` on the container we are creating
    / `ubuntu`: use the `ubuntu` base image
    / `tar caf /backup/db-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/postgresql/data`: This is the command that is run on the container.
      It #link("https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/gzip.html")[creates a compressed tar archive] from the database directory and writes it to `/backup/db-backup.tar.gz`.
  ]),
  ("<2>", [Here's our backup in the directory where we were working on the host machine.])
))

== Deliverables

Submit your `db-backup.tar.gz` file as your work for this exercise.
