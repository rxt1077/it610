= Backup

"I got a back up plan to the back up plan to back up my back up plan" -- Big Boi

== tar

* Tape Archive
* Oldest format, think zip without compression
* Often uses BSD style options `tar xvf`
* Creating a tar file: `tar cvf files.tar .`
* Extracting a tar file: `tar xvf files.tar`
* Let's take a look

== gzip/bzip2/xz

* Often used to compress a tar file
* Compression ratios xz > bzip2 > gzip
* Do you really need compression?
* Should you be compressing _where_ you are compressing?

== scp

* Transfer files to a remote more securely than FTP
* Can use keys so that you don't have to enter a password
* Can be _slow_ especially if you are repeating yourself

== rsync

* Don't repeat yourself! (DRY)
* If a file is already there and it's hash is the same, don't re-upload it
* Typically gets buried in a cronjob or a script so frankly I don't remember
  all of the options

  Practical Examples of rsync]

== Databases

* Know where your database stores it's persistent data (typically it's in the
  documentation on Docker Hub).
* Some databases use small files, others use large. This can effect your backup
  strategy.
* Some databases have built-in ways of performing backups (mysqldump)

== Network Attached Storage

* RAID is not a backup, I repeat RAID IS NOT A BACKUP!
* Some NAS solutions have built-in backup options
* Don't replicate work that has already been done by the vendor, since most
  backup needs are very similar there is typically already a built solution.

== Container Volumes

* Particularly hard to get to because they could be running in a virtual
  environment.
* Typically we spin up a container with the volume mounted _just_ to handle
  a backup operation: `docker run -v myvol:/mnt -v "$(pwd):/output" ubuntu tar cf /output/files.tar /mnt`
* On a Linux host, it's a little easier to get at the volumes, they may be
  part of your regular backup schedule.
