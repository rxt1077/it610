    - Tape Archive
    - Oldest format, think zip without compression
    - Often uses BSD style options `tar xvf`
    - Creating a tar file: `tar cvf files.tar .`
    - Extracting a tar file: `tar xvf files.tar`
    - Let's take a look

    - Often used to compress a tar file
    - Compression ratios xz > bzip2 > gzip
    - Do you really need compression?
    - Should you be compressing _where_ you are compressing?

    - Can use keys so that you don't have to enter a password
    - Can be _slow_ especially if you are repeating yourself

    - Don't repeat yourself! (DRY)
    - If a file is already there and its hash is the same, don't re-upload it
    - Typically gets buried in a cronjob or a script so frankly I don't remember all of the options

    - Know where your database stores its persistent data (typically it's in the documentation on Docker Hub).
    - Some databases use small files, others use large. This can effect your backup strategy.
    - Some databases have built-in ways of performing backups (mysqldump)

    - RAID is not a backup, I repeat RAID IS NOT A BACKUP!
    - Some NAS solutions have built-in backup options
    - Don't replicate work that has already been done by the vendor, since most backup needs are very similar there is typically already a built solution.

    - Particularly hard to get to because they could be running in a virtual environment.
    - Typically we spin up a container with the volume mounted _just_ to handle a backup operation: `docker run -v myvol:/mnt -v "$(pwd):/output" ubuntu tar cf /output/files.tar /mnt`
    - On a Linux host, it's a little easier to get at the volumes, they may be part of your regular backup schedule.
    - You can also do it from the Docker Desktop GUI!
