= Best Practices

image::sysadmin-funny.png[width=50%]

== Define your role and the problem you are addressing

* *Scope creep* - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep[continuous or
  uncontrolled growth in a project's scope]
* https://www.bmc.com/blogs/sla-template-examples/[Even (especially) internally, an SLA can help]
* Who is going to maintain this?
* Who is going to admin this?
* Don't be in charge of the coffee maker

== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle[KISS]

* Do you _really_ need that feature?
* Are you using an open source solution?
* What happens if you get sick / leave?
* Does the work flow make sense?

[.columns]
== Document, document, document

[.column.shrink]
* Collaborative documentation is important:
** Google Docs
** Wikis
** OneNote
** https://www.gitbook.com/[GitBook]
** https://antora.org/[Antora]
** Knowledge Bases
** A git repository and Markdown

[.column.shrink]
* https://www.markdowntutorial.com/[Learn markdown BTW, it’ll take a minute]
* Use https://pandoc.org/[pandoc] for people who want HTML / PDFs / etc.
* Write things down like your pedantic sysadmin prof is looking over your
  shoulder... they might be.
* You will forget and others need to know

[.columns]
== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)]

[.column.shrink]
* https://xkcd.com/1205/[Write a script]
** Bash
** https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition[Powershell]
** Python
** Ansible / Puppet / Chef
** https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant for VMs]
** https://www.docker.com/[Docker for containers]

[.column.shrink]
* Does your script follow the previous KISS principal?
* Is there data being replicated (including account info)?
* Should this be using other services? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on[SSO]?
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol[LDAP]?
* Start small, build up

[.columns]
== Build human resource capacity

[.column]

[.column]
* Take the time to explain how it works
* Talk to users, sysadmins, and management
* Avoid the ego-boost of being a linchpin
* Be approachable and friendly

[.bg]
== Have a disaster recovery plan

image::fire.jpg[background, size=cover]

* If you have backups and you’ve never practiced recovering from a backup, you
  don’t have backups
* Storage is cheaper than data
* If your good, you'll be a hero. If you're _really_ good, no one will even
  know.

== Use permissions and virtualization. Avoid root access

[.shrink]
* Can I get root? No
* Just about everything can be handled through permissions
* But I’m a dev and I need... No
* But I’m the CTO and I say... No
* I have root on my router at home and it’s only caught on fire three times.
  I think that... No
* I’m not saying to be mean, remember to build HR capacity, but very few
  things still require root access.

== Logging

* Logs are important, have / use a system
* Make them easy to get to and easy to search
* Don’t be afraid to read. What else are you going to do in the morning before
  your brain has had coffee?

== Keep learning / stay positive

* Don’t be afraid to admit you don’t know something
* Don’t be afraid to try something new
* Avoid information hoarders
* Avoid negative people
* Share your knowledge

== System Administration is dead! Long live system administration.

* A systems architect is a large-scale sysadmin with a nice title (and
  hopefully a bigger paycheck).
* Systems administration is _at the core_ of DevOps. It is the Ops.
* Prior knowledge is useful, this stuff was designed in the 70s.
