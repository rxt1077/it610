= Systems Administration with Containers

== What is a container?

A container is a fully contained Linux system that is configured exactly how
the development / operations team wants it to be configured.

* uses chroot / cgoups for isolation
* allows multiple independant Linux environments to run on one host
* more lightweight than virtual machines (VMs)
* typically coordinated through a daemon process (docker for example)

== Docker on a Desktop Machine

[plantuml, container-desktop, svg, width=50%]
....
@startuml
rectangle host [
    <b>Host OS
    ---
    Windows
    MacOS
]
rectangle vm [
    <b>Virtual Machine Running Linux
    ---
    WSL2
    VirtualBox
    HyperKit
]
rectangle docker as "Docker"
rectangle container1 as "Container 1"
rectangle container2 as "Container 2"
rectangle container3 as "Container 3"

host --> vm
vm --> docker
docker --> container1
docker --> container2
docker --> container3
@enduml
....

== Docker on a Server

[plantuml, container-server, svg, width=75%]
....
@startuml
rectangle host [
    <b>Host OS
    ---
    Linux
]
rectangle docker as "Docker"
rectangle container1 as "Container 1"
rectangle container2 as "Container 2"
rectangle container3 as "Container 3"

host --> docker
docker --> container1
docker --> container2
docker --> container3
@enduml
....

== Pets vs. Cattle

* containers have a brief lifecycle
* the configuration information for an image matters (Dockerfile)
* the actual information inside the running container does not
* store your data somewhere that isn't inside a container

=== Containers vs. Images

[plantuml, containers-vs-images, svg, width=75%]
....
@startuml
rectangle image [
    <b>Image
    ---
    Ubuntu 18.04 with custom software / configuration
]
rectangle container1 as "Container 1"
rectangle container2 as "Container 2"
rectangle container3 as "Container 3"
image --> container1 : docker run image
image --> container2 : docker run image
image --> container3 : docker run image
....

== Takeaway

* traditional Linux systems administration still matters
* focus on _how_ you set up something more than maintaining a set up you made
  earlier
* you should be able to make a script that deploys servers on demand
* everything is code
