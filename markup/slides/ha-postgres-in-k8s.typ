    This claim will be used by our one db-rw pod, so we donâ€™t have to worry about shared access.
    The supported accessModes are:

    - ReadWriteOnce - can be mounted read / write by only one pod
    - ReadOnlyMany - can be mounted read-only by many pods
    - ReadWriteMany - can be mounted as read-write by many pods

  - the selector field above defines how a _Service_ knows which pods to utilize
  - all pods with the app label db-r are used by the db-r
  - a similar rule is applied to the db-rw _Service_
  - both services accept incoming connections on port 5432 and route those connections to 5432
  - if there are multiple pods in a _Service_ a load balancing scheme is used by default
