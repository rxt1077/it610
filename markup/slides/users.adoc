= Users and Permissions

== Users

* designed for multi-user, remember Multics?
* users can be found in `/etc/passwd`
** passwords used to be in `/etc/passwd`, now in `/etc/shadow`

=== /etc/passwd format

* `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`
* username, password hash, user id, group id, friendly name, shell

NOTE: Password hashes are actually in /etc/shadow

== Groups

* multiple users may need the same access
* put those users in groups
* groups can be found in `/etc/group`
* users also have a primary group specified in `/etc/passwd`

== Permissions

=== UNIX Permissions

[.shrink]
* chmod is a utility used to modify permissions
* `chmod 666 /tmp/have-at-it.txt`
* `chmod 644 /tmp/mine-but-you-can-read-it.txt`
* `chmod 600 /tmp/mine-keep-out.txt` 

== Utilities

=== useradd/userdel/usermod

[.shrink]
* editing `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/group` can go poorly
* these basic commands let you add, delete, and modify users from the command
  line
* `useradd ryan -g users`: Add a user named ryan in the group users
* `usermod ryan -a -G sudoers`: Add ryan to the sudoers group too
* `userdel ryan`: Delete ryan
* man pages: https://linux.die.net/man/8/useradd[useradd],
  https://linux.die.net/man/8/usermod[usermod],
  and https://linux.die.net/man/8/userdel[userdel]
* these are low-level commands they may not handle things like home directories!

=== chown/chmod

* chmod was already covered
* chown lets you change the owner _and_ group: `chown ryan.devs roadmap.py`
* both of these have _recursive_ options
* man pages: https://linux.die.net/man/1/chown[chown],
  https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod[chmod]

=== su/sudo

* su lets you run a shell (or a command) as any user
* sudo lets you run commands typically as root


=== groups

* shows you the groups you are in by default
* can also show you the groups someone else is in `groups ryan`

WARNING: Users need to re-login to have their groups updated
