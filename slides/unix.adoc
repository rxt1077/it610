= UNIX Systems

== Multics

* MIT, AT&T, and GE
* Timesharing system for mainframes
* Monolithic
* Mainframe time was expensive
* http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/[Unwieldy code]

== What's next?

[quote, Dennis Ritchie]
What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do
programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from
experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access,
time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a
keypunch, but to encourage close communication.

== Inception

* Smaller group of developers (Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, Joe Ossanna…)
* Smaller code base
* Simulations on old Multics mainframes later developed on PDP-7/PDP-11/20
* Man pages were a HUGE development
* Anti-trust suit means they have to give it away

== Growth

* Rewritten in C
* Takes over Bell Labs
* BSD Unix developed as an alternative to Bell Labs restrictive licensing
* Standards develop (System V, POSIX)
* Alternatives grow in parallel (Minix, Linux, etc.)

== Key Concepts

[.column]
* Do one thing well
* Everything is a file
* Pipes
* Document

[.column]
* RTFM
* Steep learning curve = high productivity
* Multiuser by design
* Networking by design
* Uptime

== Linux

* Developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, meant for x86 but lots of ports today
* Linux is the kernel, there are many distributions

=== Debian Based Distributions

* Debian
* Ubuntu
** Mint

=== Redhat Based Distributions

* RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux)
* CentOS
* Amazon Linux

=== Other Distributions

* Arch
* Slackware

== What's next?

* Microkernels?
* https://www.redox-os.org/[Redox?]
* Functional Package Management? (https://guix.gnu.org/[GUIX], https://guix.gnu.org/[Nix])
